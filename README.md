## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

A salary calculator/data storage program was needed to take in the salary information of each employee and calculate the total monthly cost to show if employees salaries are within budget. 
Each employees information can be entered on the webpage which will store the information in an array, and display it on the webpage (DOM). A series of functions will take the inputed salary info and run it through the calculator, which will then display the monthly salary cost (of all employees entered) on the webpage.
